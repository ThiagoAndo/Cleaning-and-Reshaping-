# Tidying Data

The data is not in tidy format. Reason: In Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey 2017 - Participation,
the clumms age brackets are distributed over columns that directly violate tidy data rules. To make data a tidy df, a gather operation is to be performed to create a column with age brackets as different levels of columns.

You can understand better about tidy data rules [here.](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) 

To tidy these data a good portion of the gamut of tidyverse techniques will be used.

 * Read Excel files using `XLConnect`
 * Dropping rows and reshaping data with `tidyr` 
 * Filtering,and mutating with `dplyr`
 * Cleaning column names with `janitor`
 * Manipulating strings with `stringr` and `rebus`
